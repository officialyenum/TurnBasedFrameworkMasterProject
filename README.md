# TurnBasedFrameworkMasterProject
A Masters Project R &amp; D on A YU-GI-OH-inspired turn-based card game featuring advanced AI-driven gameplay. utilizing a deck of cards to summon creatures, cast spells, and traps. The game will showcase sophisticated AI opponents using algorithms like Alpha-beta pruning, Monte Carlo methods, and Reinforcement Learning to make informed decisions.

## Gameplay Mechanics
1. Card Decks:
   - Each player has a deck of 10-20 cards.
   - Cards are divided into three types: Monsters, Spells, and Traps.

2. Turns:
   - Players take turns drawing cards, playing cards, and executing strategies.
   - Each turn has phases: Draw Phase, Main Phase, Battle Phase, and End Phase.

3. Battles:
   - Players can summon monsters to attack or defend.
   - Spells and traps can be used for strategic advantages.

4. Winning Conditions:
   - Reduce opponentâ€™s life points to zero.
   - Alternative win conditions through specific card effects.

AI Mechanics
1. Decision Making:
   - Implement AI algorithms (Alpha-beta pruning, Monte Carlo, Genetic Algorithms, Reinforcement Learning) for opponent decision-making.
   - AI uses past battle data to make better future decisions.

2. Adaptive Strategies:
   - AI adapts its strategy based on player behavior and game state.
   - Dynamic difficulty adjustment to keep the game challenging.
  
## Expected End Product
- A fully functional YU-GI-OH-inspired game:
  - Enhanced AI and engaging gameplay mechanics.
  - 1v1 and potential 5v5 battle modes with animations.
  - AI using past battle history for decision-making.

- Unreal Engine 5 Template/Plugin:
  - Simplifying the development of similar games.
  - Focuses on AI and gameplay (GAS) programming.
